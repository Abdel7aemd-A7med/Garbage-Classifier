# Garbage Classification Model

This project is a deep learning model designed to classify garbage into 10 distinct categories using images. It was developed as part of a machine learning training program at the National Telecommunication Institute (NTI). The goal is to automate waste classification to support recycling and waste management efforts.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used for this project is publicly available on Kaggle:  
[Garbage Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumn2u/garbage-classification-v2)

It contains images grouped into the following 10 categories:

- Battery
- Biological
- Cardboard
- Clothes
- Glass
- Metal
- Paper
- Plastic
- Shoes
- Trash

## 🧠 Model
We used **MobileNetV2**, a lightweight and efficient convolutional neural network suitable for mobile and edge devices. This model was fine-tuned on the garbage dataset to achieve high accuracy with low computational requirements.

## 🚀 How to Use
You can try the model through a simple web interface hosted on Hugging Face Spaces:  
🔗 [Live Demo on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/abdelhamed20/2)

Upload an image of garbage and the model will predict its category.
